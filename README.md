# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Joby Chacko

I'm a DevOps enthusiast and software developer passionate about cloud computing, CI/CD pipelines, and containerization. Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing a Post-Graduate Diploma in DevOps for Cloud Computing at Lambton College, where Iâ€™m enhancing my skills in cloud architecture, Kubernetes, Docker, and infrastructure automation.

With hands-on experience in projects involving GCP, AWS, SQL Server, Docker, and CI/CD, Iâ€™m eager to continue growing and contributing to impactful projects. When Iâ€™m not coding, you might find me exploring new tech trends or volunteering in my community.
